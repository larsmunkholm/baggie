# ColorComparison

Find the nearest or farthest matching colors.

Create a set of available or accepted colors, and in this set find the closest or farthest match to any other color.

> **Nerd alert:** Colors are converted to the [CIELAB color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space)
> (Lab), which is designed to be "perceptually uniform" with respect to human vision, meaning that the same amount of
> numerical change in these values corresponds to about the same amount of visually perceived change. Colors are then
> matched using the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) formula.

## Example

<Example compareColor="#ff7711" colors={["#ff0000", "#ffff00", "#ff00ff", "#00ffff", "#00ff00"]} />
