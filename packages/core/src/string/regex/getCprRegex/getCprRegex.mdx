# getCprRegex

A regular expression for validating the format of a Danish CPR number
(personal identification number).

Works with the birthdate and the four control digits combined or separated
by a dash or whitespace.

> **Be aware** that this does not check if the CPR number is valid.
> **It only checks if the format is correct.**
>
> This makes it useful for the pattern attribute in an input field.

## Example

<Example cprNumber="1706862134" />
