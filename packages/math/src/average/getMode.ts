/**
 * Get the mode from an array of numbers.
 * The mode is the most frequent value in a data set
 *
 * There can be more than one mode if multiple values
 * are repeated an equal amount of times.
 *
 * @example
 * **Basic usage:**
 * ```ts
 * import { getMode } from "@baggie/math";
 *
 * const numbers = [4, 8, 8, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 42, 42];
 * const mode = getMode(numbers);
 * // mode = { mode: [8, 42], frequency: 3 }
 * ```
